This repository includes the files in the paper titled: "Machine learning algorithm to estimate cardiac output based on non-invasive arterial blood pressure measurements."
This research applied the SINDy algorithm to discover features that relate arterial blood pressure to cardiac output. The optimum number of cardiac cycles needed to extract features was also examined.
